Here are the explanations about the processing class under every cecilia5 module.

# Declaration of the module's class

Every module must contain a class named 'Module', where the audio processing
will be developed. In order to work properly inside the environment, this 
class must inherit from the `BaseModule` class, defined inside the Cecilia 
source code. The BaseModule's internals create all links between the interface 
and the module's processing. A Cecilia module must be declared like this:

###########################################################################
class Module(BaseModule):
    '''
    Module's documentation
    '''
    def __init__(self):
        BaseModule.__init__(self)
        ### Here comes the processing chain...
###########################################################################

The module file will be executed in an environment where both `BaseModule` and
`pyo` are already available. No need to import anything specific to define the
audio process of the module.

# Module's output

The last object of the processing chain (ie the one producing the output sound) 
must be called 'self.out'. The audio server gets the sound from this variable 
and sends it to the Post-Processing plugins and from there, to the soundcard.

Here is an example of a typical output variable, where 'self.snd' is the dry 
sound and 'self.dsp' is the processed sound. 'self.drywet' is a mixing slider 
and 'self.env' is the overall gain from a grapher's line:

###########################################################################
self.out = Interp(self.snd, self.dsp, self.drywet, mul=self.env)
###########################################################################

# Module's documentation

The class should provide a __doc__ string giving relevant information about
the processing implemented by the module. The user can show the documentation
by selecting 'Help Menu' ---> 'Show Module Info'. Here is an example:

    "Convolution brickwall lowpass/highpass/bandpass/bandstop filter"
    
    Description

    Convolution filter with a user-defined length sinc kernel. This
    kind of filters are very CPU expensive but can give quite good
    stopband attenuation.
    
    Sliders

        # Cutoff Frequency :
            Cutoff frequency, in Hz, of the filter.
        # Bandwidth :
            Bandwith, in Hz, of the filter. 
            Used only by bandpass and pnadstop filters.
        # Filter Order :
            Number of points of the filter kernel. A longer kernel means
            a sharper attenuation (and a higher CPU cost). This value is
            only available at initialization time.

        # Overall Amplitude : 
            The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

    Popups & Toggles

        # Filter Type :
            Type of the filter (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop)
        # Balance :
            Compression mode. Off, balanced with a fixed signal
            or balanced with the input source.
        # Polyphony Voices : 
            Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
            only available at initialization time
        # Polyphony Spread : 
            Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
            only available at initialization time

Public Methods

These are the methods, defined in the BaseModule class, available to the 
user to help in the design of his custom modules.

# self.addFilein(name) : 
    Creates a SndTable object from the name of a cfilein widget.
# self.addSampler(name, pitch, amp) : 
    Creates a sampler/looper from the name of a csampler widget.

    Sets the Server's global seed used by objects from the random family.

Template

This template, saved in a file with the extension '.c5', created a basic 
module where a sound can be load in a sampler for reading, with optional 
polyphonic playback. A graph envelope modulates the amplitude of the sound 
over the performance duration.

    cfilein(name='filein', label='Audio', help='')
    
    Description
    
    This interactive menu allows the user to import a soundfile into the 
    processing module. When the user chooses a sound using the interface,
    Cecilia will scan the whole folder for soundfiles. A submenu containing 
    all soundfiles present in the folder will allow a quicker access to them 
    later on.

    More than one cfilein can be defined in a module. They will appear under 
    the input label in the left side panel of the main window, in the order 
    defined. 

    In the processing class, use the BaseModule's method `addFilein` to 
    retrieve the SndTable filled with the selected sound.
    
        >>> BaseModule.addFilein(name)

        # name : str
            A string passed to the parameter `name` of the BaseModule.addFilein
            method. This method returns a SndTable object containing Cecilia's

    quicker access to them later on. Loop points, pitch and amplitude 
    parameters of the loaded soundfile can be controlled by the csampler 
    window that drops when clicking the triangle just besides the name of 
    the sound.
    
    A sampler returns an audio variable containing Cecilia's number of 
    output channels regardless of the number of channels in the soundfile. 
    A distribution algorithm is used to assign X number of channels to Y 
    number of outputs.
    
    In the processing class, use the BaseModule's method `addSampler` to

    cpoly(name='poly', label='Polyphony', min=1, max=10, init=1, help='')
    
    Description
    
    cpoly is a widget conceived to help manage the voice polyphony of a 
    module. cpoly comes with a popup menu that allows the user to choose how 
    many instances (voices) of a process will be simultaneously playing. It 
    also provides another popup to choose the type of polyphony (phasing, 
    chorus, out-of-tune or one of the provided chords).

    cpoly has two values that are passed to the processing module: the number 
    of voices and the voice spread. The number of voices can be collected 
    using `self.number_of_voices`. `self.polyphony_spread` gives access to 
    the transposition factors defined by the type of polyphony.

    If a csampler is used, you don't need to take care of polyphony, it's 
    automatically handled inside the csampler. Without a csampler, user can 
    retrieve polyphony popups values with these builtin reserved 
    variables :
        
        # self.number_of_voices : int
            Number of layers of polyphony
        # self.polyphony_spread : list of floats
            Transposition factors as a list of floats
        # self.polyphony_scaling : float
            An amplitude factor based on the number of voices

    Notes 
    
    The cpoly interface object and its associated variables can be used in 
    the dsp module any way one sees fit.

    No more than one `cpoly` can be declared in a module.

    Parameters

        # name : str
            Name of the widget.
        # label : str

    Description
    
    A graph line represents the evolution of a variable during a Cecilia 
    performance. The value of the graph is passed to the module with a 
    variable named `self.name`. The 'func' argument defines an initial 
    break-point line shaped with time/value pairs (floats) as a list. Time 
    values must be defined from 0 to 1 and are multiplied by the total_time 
    of the process. When True, the 'table' argument writes the graph line in 
    a PyoTableObject named with the variable `self.name`. The graph can then 
    be used for any purpose in the module by recalling its variable. The 
    `col` argument defines the color of the graph line using a color value.

    Description

    When created, the slider is stacked in the slider pane of the main Cecilia
    window in the order it is defined. The value of the slider is passed to 
    the module with a variable named `self.name`. The `up` argument passes 
    the value of the slider on mouse up if set to True or continuously if set 
    to False. The `gliss` argument determines the duration of the portamento 
    (in seconds) applied between values. The portamento is automatically set 
    to 0 if `up` is True. The resolution of the slider can be set to int or 
    float using the `res` argument. Slider color can be set using the `col` 
    argument and a color value. However, sliders with `up` set to True are 
    greyed out and the `col` argument is ignored.

    If `up` is set to True, the cslider will not create an audio rate signal,
    but will call a method named `widget_name` + '_up'. This method must be 
    defined in the class `Module`. For a cslider with the name 'grains', the
    method should be declared like this:

    >>> def grains_up(self, value):
    
    Every time a slider is defined with `up` set to False, a corresponding 
    graph line is automatically defined for the grapher in the Cecilia 
    interface. The recording and playback of an automated slider is linked 
    to its graph line.
    
    Parameters
    
        # name : str
            Name of the slider.
        # label : str
            Label shown in the slider label and the grapher popup.
        # min : float
            Minimum value of the slider.
        # max : float

    Description
    
    This function creates a two-sided slider used to control a minimum and 
    a maximum range at the sime time. When created, the range slider is 
    stacked in the slider pane of the main Cecilia window in the order it 
    is defined. The values of the range slider are passed to the module 
    with a variable named `self.name`. The range minimum is collected using 
    `self.name[0]` and the range maximum is collected using `self.name[1]`. 
    The `up` argument passes the values of the range on mouse up if set to 
    True or continuously if set to False. The `gliss` argument determines 
    the duration of the portamento (in sec) applied on a new value. The 
    resolution of the range slider can be set to 'int' or 'float' using the 
    `res` argument. Slider color can be set using the `col` argument and a 
    color value. However, sliders with `up` set to True are greyed out and 
    the `col` argument is ignored.

    Every time a range slider is defined, two graph lines are automatically 
    defined for the grapher in the Cecilia interface. One is linked to the 
    minimum value of the range, the other one to the maximum value of the 
    range. The recording and playback of an automated slider is linked to its 
    graph line.

    Notes 
    
    In order to quickly select the minimum value (and graph line), the user 
    can click on the left side of the crange label, and on the right side of 
    the label to select the maximum value (and graph line).

    Parameters
    
        # name : str
            Name of the range slider.
        # label : str
            Label shown in the crange label and the grapher popup.

    Description
    
    When created, the splitter is stacked in the slider pane of the main 
    Cecilia window in the order it is defined. The values of the splitter 
    slider are passed to the module with a variable named `self.name`. The 
    knob values are collected using `self.name[0]` to `self.name[num-knobs-1]`.
    The `up` argument passes the values of the splitter on mouse up if set to 
    True or continuously if set to False. The `gliss` argument determines the 
    duration of the portamento (in seconds) applied between values. The 
    resolution of the splitter slider can be set to int or float using the 
    `res` argument. The slider color can be set using the `col` argument and 
    a color value. However, sliders with `up` set to True are greyed out and 
    the `col` argument is ignored.

    The csplitter is designed to be used with the FourBand() object in
    order to allow multi-band processing. Although the FourBand() parameters 
    can be changed at audio rate, it is not recommended. This filter is CPU 
    intensive and can have erratic behavior when boundaries are changed too 
    quickly.
