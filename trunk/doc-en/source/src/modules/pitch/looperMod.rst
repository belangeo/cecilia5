LooperMod
==============

Looper module with optional amplitude and frequency modulation.

Sliders under the graph:
    - AM Range: Amplitude of the amplitude modulation LFO (low frequency oscillator).
    - AM Speed: Frequency of the amplitude modulation LFO.
    - FM Range: Amplitude of the frequency modulation LFO.
    - FM Speed: Frequency of the frequency modulation LFO.
    - Loop Range: Range in the soundfile to loop.
    - Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the processed signal.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - AM LFO Type: Waveform of the amplitude modulation wave (saw up, saw down, square, triangle, pulse, bipolar pulse, sample and hold or modulated sine).
    - AM On/Off: To enable or disable the amplitude modulation.
    - FM LFO Type: Waveform of the amplitude modulation wave (saw up, saw down, square, triangle, pulse, bipolar pulse, sample and hold or modulated sine).
    - FM On/Off: To enable or disable the frequency modulation.
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
