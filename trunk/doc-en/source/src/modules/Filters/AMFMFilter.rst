AMFMFilter : AM/FM modulated filter
===================================

Description
------------

The input sound is filtered by a variable type modulated filter.
Speed, depth and shape can be modified for both AM and FM modulators.

Sliders
--------

    **Filter Mean Freq** : 
        Mean frequency of the filter
    **Resonance** : 
        Q factor of the filter
    **AM Depth** : 
        Amplitude of the amplitude modulator
    **AM Freq** : 
        Speed, in Hz, of the amplitude modulator 
    **FM Depth** : 
        Amplitude of the frequency modulator
    **FM Freq** : 
        Speed, in Hz, of the frequency modulator 
    **Mod Sharpness** :
        Sharpness of waveforms used as modulators
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the filtered signal

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Filter Type** : 
        Type of filter
    **AM Mod Type** : 
        Shape of the amplitude modulator
    **FM Mod Type** : 
        Shape of the frequency modulator
    **Balance** :
        Compression mode. Off, balanced with a fixed signal
        or balanced with the input source.
    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
