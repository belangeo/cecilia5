Sliders under the graph:
    - Frequency Splitter: Split points in the frequency range for multi-band processing.
    - Transpo Band 1: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the first band.
    - Feedback Band 1: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the first band harmonizer. 
    - Gain Band 1: Gain of the harmonized first band.
    - Transpo Band 2: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the second band.
    - Feedback Band 2: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the second band harmonizer. 
    - Gain Band 2: Gain of the harmonized second band.
    - Transpo Band 3: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the third band.
    - Feedback Band 3: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the third band harmonizer. 
    - Gain Band 3: Gain of the harmonized third band.
    - Transpo Band 4: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the fourth band.
    - Feedback Band 4: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the fourth band harmonizer. 
    - Gain Band 4: Gain of the harmonized fourth band.
    - Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the harmonized signals.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - Win Size: Window size (for delay). **à préciser**
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
