Sliders under the graph:
    - Frequency splitter: Split points in frequency range for multi-band processing.
    - Freq Shift Band 1: Frequency shift of the first band (in Hertz).
    - Gain Band 1: Gain of the shifted first band.
    - Freq Shift Band 2: Frequency shift of the second band (in Hertz).
    - Gain Band 2: Gain of the shifted second band.
    - Freq Shift Band 3: Frequency shift of the third band (in Hertz).
    - Gain Band 3: Gain of the shifted third band.
    - Freq Shift Band 4: Frequency shift of the fourth band (in Hertz).
    - Gain Band 4: Gain of the shifted fourth band.
    - Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the shifted signals.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
