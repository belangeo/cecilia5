Sliders under the graph:
    - Frequency Splitter: Split points in the frequency range for multi-band processing.
    - Delay Band 1: Delay time for the first band (in seconds).
    - Feedback Band 1: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the first band delay.
    - Gain Band 1: Gain of the delayed first band (in decibels).
    - Delay Band 2: Delay time for the second band (in seconds).
    - Feedback Band 2: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the second band delay.
    - Gain Band 2: Gain of the delayed second band (in decibels).
    - Delay Band 3: Delay time for the third band (in seconds).
    - Feedback Band 3: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the third band delay.
    - Gain Band 3: Gain of the delayed third band (in decibels).
    - Delay Band 4: Delay time for the fourth band (in seconds).
    - Feedback Band 4: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the fourth band delay.
    - Gain Band 4: Gain of the delayed fourth band (in decibels).

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
