=============

Parametric equalization module.

Sliders under the graph:
    - Freq 1 Boost/Cut: Gain of the first equalizer.
    - Freq 1: Center or cut-off frequency of the first equalizer.
    - Freq 1 Q: Q factor of the first equalizer.
    - Freq 2 Boost/Cut: Gain of the second equalizer.
    - Freq 2: Center or cut-off frequency of the second equalizer.
    - Freq 2 Q: Q factor of the second equalizer.
    - Freq 3 Boost/Cut: Gain of the third equalizer.
    - Freq 3: Center or cut-off frequency of the third equalizer.
    - Freq 3 Q: Q factor of the third equalizer.
    - Freq 4 Boost/Cut: Gain of the fourth equalizer.
    - Freq 4: Center or cut-off frequency of the fourth equalizer.
    - Freq 4 Q: Q factor of the fourth equalizer.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - EQ 1 Type: Type of the first equalizer (Peak/Notch, Lowshelf, Highshelf).
    - EQ 2 Type: Type of the second equalizer (Peak/Notch, Lowshelf, Highshelf).
    - EQ 3 Type: Type of the third equalizer (Peak/Notch, Lowshelf, Highshelf).
    - EQ 4 Type: Type of the fourth equalizer (Peak/Notch, Lowshelf, Highshelf).
    - Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
