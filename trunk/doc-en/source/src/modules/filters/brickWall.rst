==========

Convolution brickwall lowpass or highpass filter.


.. image:: /images/Parametres_BrickWall.png

Sliders under the graph:
    - Cut-off Frequency: cut-off frequency of the lowpass/highpass filter.
    - Bandwidth: Bandwidth of the lowpass/highpass filter.
    - Filter order: Filter order of the lowpass/highpass filter.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
    - Label Type: Type of filter (lowpass or highpass).
    - Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
    - # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
    - Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
    - Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
