=========================================

Description
------------

Four voices beat generator where sounds are extracted from a soundfile.

Sliders
--------

    **Num of Taps** : 
        Number of taps in a measure
    **Tempo** : 
        Speed of taps in BPM (ref. to quarter note)
    **Beat 1 Tap Length** :

    **Beat 1 Index** : 
        Soundfile index of the first beat
    **Beat 1 Gain** : 
        Gain of the first beat
    **Beat 1 Distribution** : 
        Repartition of taps for the first beat (100% weak <--> 100% down)
    **Beat 2 Tap Length** : 
        Length of taps of the second beat, in seconds
    **Beat 2 Index** : 
        Soundfile index of the second beat
    **Beat 2 Gain** : 
        Gain of the second beat
    **Beat 2 Distribution** : 
        Repartition of taps for the second beat (100% weak <--> 100% down)
    **Beat 3 Tap Length** : 
        Length of taps of the third beat, in seconds
    **Beat 3 Index** : 
        Soundfile index of the third beat
    **Beat 3 Gain** : 
        Gain of the third beat
    **Beat 3 Distribution** : 
        Repartition of taps for the third beat (100% weak <--> 100% down)
    **Beat 4 Tap Length** : 
        Length of taps of the fourth beat, in seconds
    **Beat 4 Index** : 
        Soundfile index of the fourth beat
    **Beat 4 Gain** : 
        Gain of the fourth beat
    **Beat 4 Distribution** : 
        Repartition of taps for the fourth beat (100% weak <--> 100% down)
    **Global Seed** : 
        Seed value for the algorithmic beats, using the same seed with 
        the same distributions will yield the exact same beats.
