4Delays : Two stereo delays with parallel or serial routing
===========================================================

Description
------------

A classical module implementing a pair of stereo delays
with user-defined delay time, feedback and gain. Routing
of delays and filters can be defined with the popup menus.

Sliders
--------

    **Delay 1 Left** : 
        Delay one, left channel, delay time in seconds
    **Delay 1 Right** : 
        Delay one, right channel, delay time in seconds
    **Delay 1 Feedback** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back to the delay line input
    **Delay 1 Gain** : 
        Gain of the delayed signal
    **Delay 2 Left** : 
        Delay two, left channel, delay time in seconds
    **Delay 2 Right** : 
        Delay two, right channel, delay time in seconds
    **Delay 2 Feedback** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back to the delay line input
    **Delay 2 Gain** : 
        Gain of the delayed signal
    **Jitter Amp** : 
        Amplitude of the jitter applied on the delay times
    **Jitter Speed** : 
        Speed of the jitter applied on the delay times
    **Filter Freq** : 
        Cutoff or center frequency of the filter
    **Filter Q** : 
        Q factor of the filter
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the processed signals

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Delay Routing** : 
        Type of routing
    **Filter Type** : 
        Type of filter
    **Filter Routing** : 
        Specify if the filter is pre or post process
    **Balance** :
        Compression mode. Off, balanced with a fixed signal
        or balanced with the input source.
    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
