DelayMod : Stereo delay module with LFO on delay times
======================================================

Description
------------

A stereo delay whose delay times are modulated with LFO of different shapes.

Sliders
--------

    **Delay Time L** : 
        Delay time of the left channel delay
    **Delay Time R** : 
        Delay time of the right channel delay
    **LFO Depth L** : 
        Amplitude of the LFO applied on left channel delay time
    **LFO Depth R** : 
        Amplitude of the LFO applied on right channel delay time
    **LFO Freq L** : 
        Frequency of the LFO applied on left channel delay time
    **LFO Freq R** : 
        Frequency of the LFO applied on right channel delay time
    **Gain Delay L** : 
        Amplitude of the left channel delay
    **Gain Delay R** : 
        Amplitude of the right channel delay
    **Feedback** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back in the delay chain
    **LFO Sharpness** : 
        Sharper waveform results in more harmonics in the LFO spectrum.
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the delayed signals

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **LFO Waveform L** : 
        Shape of the LFO waveform applied on left channel delay
    **LFO Waveform R** : 
        Shape of the LFO waveform applied on right channel delay
    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
