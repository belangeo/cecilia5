    **Base Frequency** : 
        Base pitch of the synthesis
    **Partials Spread** : 
        Distance between partials
    **Partials Freq Rand Amp** : 
        Amplitude of the jitter applied on the partials pitch
    **Partials Freq Rand Speed** : 
        Frequency of the jitter applied on the partials pitch
    **Partials Amp Rand Amp** : 
        Amplitude of the jitter applied on the partials amplitude
    **Partials Amp Rand Speed** : 
        Frequency of the jitter applied on the partials amplitude
    **Amplitude Factor** : 
        Spread of amplitude between partials
    **Chorus Depth** : 
        Amplitude of the chorus
    **Chorus Feedback** : 
        Amount of chorused signal fed back to the chorus
    **Chorus Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original synthesis and the chorused signal
