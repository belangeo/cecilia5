MultiBandFreqShift : Multi-band frequency shifter module
========================================================

Description
------------

MultiBandFreqShift implements four separated spectral band 
frequency shifters with independent amount of shift and gain.

Sliders
--------

    **Frequency Splitter** : 
        Split points for multi-band processing
    **Freq Shift Band 1** : 
        Shift frequency of first band
    **Gain Band 1** : 
        Gain of the shifted first band
    **Freq Shift Band 2** : 
        Shift frequency of second band
    **Gain Band 2** : 
        Gain of the shifted second band
    **Freq Shift Band 3** : 
        Shift frequency of third band
    **Gain Band 3** : 
        Gain of the shifted third band
    **Freq Shift Band 4** : 
        Shift frequency of fourth band
    **Gain Band 5** : 
        Gain of the shifted fourth band
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the shifted signals

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
