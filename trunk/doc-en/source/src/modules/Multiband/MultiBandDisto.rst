MultiBandDisto : Multi-band distortion module
=============================================

Description
------------

MultiBandDisto implements four separated spectral band distortions
with independent drive, slope and gain.

Sliders
--------

    **Frequency Splitter** : 
        Split points for multi-band processing
    **Band 1 Drive** : 
        Amount of distortion applied on the first band
    **Band 1 Slope** : 
        Harshness of distorted first band
    **Band 1 Gain** : 
        Gain of the distorted first band
    **Band 2 Drive** : 
        Amount of distortion applied on the second band
    **Band 2 Slope** : 
        Harshness of distorted second band
    **Band 2 Gain** : 
        Gain of the distorted second band
    **Band 3 Drive** : 
        Amount of distortion applied on the third band
    **Band 3 Slope** : 
        Harshness of distorted third band
    **Band 3 Gain** : 
        Gain of the distorted third band
    **Band 4 Drive** : 
        Amount of distortion applied on the fourth band
    **Band 4 Slope** : 
        Harshness of distorted fourth band
    **Band 4 Gain** : 
        Gain of the distorted fourth band
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the delayed signals

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
