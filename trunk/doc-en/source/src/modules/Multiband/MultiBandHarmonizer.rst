MultiBandHarmonizer : Multi-band harmonizer module
==================================================

Description
------------

MultiBandHarmonizer implements four separated spectral band 
harmonizers with independent transposition, feedback and gain.

Sliders
--------

    **Frequency Splitter** : 
        Split points for multi-band processing
    **Transpo Band 1** : 
        Pitch shift for the first band
    **Feedback Band 1** : 
        Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the first band harmonizer
    **Gain Band 1** : 
        Gain of the harmonized first band
    **Transpo Band 2** : 
        Pitch shift for the second band
    **Feedback Band 2** : 
        Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the second band harmonizer
    **Gain Band 2** : 
        Gain of the harmonized second band
    **Transpo Band 3** : 
        Pitch shift for the third band
    **Feedback Band 3** : 
        Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the third band harmonizer
    **Gain Band 3** : 
        Gain of the harmonized third band
    **Transpo Band 4** : 
        Pitch shift for the fourth band
    **Feedback Band 4** : 
        Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the fourth band harmonizer
    **Gain Band 4** : 
        Gain of the harmonized fourth band
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the harmonized signals

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Win Size** : 
        Harmonizer window size (delay) in seconds
    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
