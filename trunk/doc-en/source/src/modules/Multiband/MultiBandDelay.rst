MultiBandDelay : Multi-band delay with feedback
===============================================

Description
------------

MultiBandDelay implements four separated spectral band delays
with independent delay time, gain and feedback.

Sliders
--------

    **Frequency Splitter** : 
        Split points for multi-band processing
    **Delay Band 1** : 
        Delay time for the first band
    **Feedback Band 1** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back into the first band delay
    **Gain Band 1** : 
        Gain of the delayed first band
    **Delay Band 2** : 
        Delay time for the second band
    **Feedback Band 2** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back into the second band delay
    **Gain Band 2** : 
        Gain of the delayed second band
    **Delay Band 3** : 
        Delay time for the third band
    **Feedback Band 3** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back into the third band delay
    **Gain Band 3** : 
        Gain of the delayed third band
    **Delay Band 4** : 
        Delay time for the fourth band
    **Feedback Band 4** : 
        Amount of delayed signal fed back into the fourth band delay
    **Gain Band 4** : 
        Gain of the delayed fourth band
    **Dry / Wet** : 
        Mix between the original signal and the delayed signals

Graph Only

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
