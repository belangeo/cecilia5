Distortion : Arctangent distortion module with pre and post filters
===================================================================

Description
------------

This module applies an arctangent distortion with control on the amount
of drive and pre/post filtering.

Sliders
--------

    **Pre Filter Freq** : 
        Center frequency of the filter applied before distortion
    **Pre Filter Q** : 
        Q factor of the filter applied before distortion
    **Drive** : 
        Amount of distortion applied on the signal
    **Post Filter Freq** : 
        Center frequency of the filter applied after distortion
    **Post Filter Q** : 
        Q factor of the filter applied after distortion

Graph Only
-----------

    **Overall Amplitude** : 
        The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance

Popups & Toggles
-----------------

    **Pre Filter Type** : 
        Type of filter used before distortion
    **Post Filter Type** : 
        Type of filter used after distortion
    **Polyphony Voices** : 
        Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony), 
        only available at initialization time
    **Polyphony Spread** : 
        Pitch variation between voices (chorus), 
        only available at initialization time
