Cecilia is an audio signal processing environment. Cecilia lets you create your own GUI (grapher, 
sliders, toggles, popup menus) using a simple syntax. Cecilia comes with many original built-in 
modules for sound effects and synthesis.

Previously written in tcl/tk by Jean Piché and Alexandre Burton, Cecilia (version 4, deprecated) 
was entirely rewritten in Python/wxPython and used the Python-Csound API for communicating between 
the interface and the audio engine. Version 4.2 is the final release of version 4.

Cecilia5 now uses Pyo, an audio engine written in C and created for the Python programming language. 
Pyo allows a much more powerful integration of the audio engine to the graphical interface. Since it 
is a standard python module, there is no need to use an API to communicate with the interface.

Cecilia is free and open source (`GNU GPL v3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_). 
Cecilia is programmed and maintained by Olivier Bélanger.
