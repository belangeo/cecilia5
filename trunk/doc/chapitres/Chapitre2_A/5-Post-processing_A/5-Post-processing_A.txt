In this tab, you can add post-processing effects on the output audio file. It is possible to add up to 3 post-processing modules.  Signal routing is from top to bottom.  Set audio parameters with the buttons on the left side.  Computation must be restarted for the post-processing to take effects.

Choose the post-processing module in the "Effects" menu. The "Type" menu allows you to alternate between active module and bypass or to make a choice between different options, depending of the module.
