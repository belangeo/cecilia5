Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency Splitter: Split points in the frequency range for multi-band processing.
\item Threshold Band 1: Value in decibels at which the gate becomes active on the first band.
\item Gain Band 1: Gain of the gated first band (in decibels). 
\item Threshold Band 2: Value in decibels at which the gate becomes active on the second band.
\item Gain Band 2: Gain of the gated second band (in decibels).
\item Threshold Band 3: Value in decibels at which the gate becomes active on the third band.
\item Gain Band 3: Gain of the gated third band (in decibels).
\item Threshold Band 4: Value in decibels at which the gate becomes active on the fourth band.
\item Gain Band 4: Gain of the gated fourth band (in decibels).
\item Rise Time: Time taken by the gate to close (in seconds).
\item Fall Time: Time taken by the gate to re-open (in seconds).
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
