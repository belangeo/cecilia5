Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency Splitter: Split points in the frequency range for multi-band processing.
\item Delay Band 1: Delay time for the first band (in seconds).
\item Feedback Band 1: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the first band delay.
\item Gain Band 1: Gain of the delayed first band (in decibels).
\item Delay Band 2: Delay time for the second band (in seconds).
\item Feedback Band 2: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the second band delay.
\item Gain Band 2: Gain of the delayed second band (in decibels).
\item Delay Band 3: Delay time for the third band (in seconds).
\item Feedback Band 3: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the third band delay.
\item Gain Band 3: Gain of the delayed third band (in decibels).
\item Delay Band 4: Delay time for the fourth band (in seconds).
\item Feedback Band 4: Amount of delayed signal fed back into the fourth band delay.
\item Gain Band 4: Gain of the delayed fourth band (in decibels).
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
