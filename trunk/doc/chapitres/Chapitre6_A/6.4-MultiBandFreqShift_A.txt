Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency splitter: Split points in frequency range for multi-band processing.
\item Freq Shift Band 1: Frequency shift of the first band (in Hertz).
\item Gain Band 1: Gain of the shifted first band.
\item Freq Shift Band 2: Frequency shift of the second band (in Hertz).
\item Gain Band 2: Gain of the shifted second band.
\item Freq Shift Band 3: Frequency shift of the third band (in Hertz).
\item Gain Band 3: Gain of the shifted third band.
\item Freq Shift Band 4: Frequency shift of the fourth band (in Hertz).
\item Gain Band 4: Gain of the shifted fourth band.
\item Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the shifted signals.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
