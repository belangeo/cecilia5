Filtering module that works with an amplitude modulation (AM filter) or a frequency modulation (FM filter).

**image 1-Parametres_AMFilter.png**

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter Freq: Center or cut-off frequency of the filter.
\item Resonance: Q factor (resonance) of the filter.
\item Mod Depth: Amplitude of the modulating wave (LFO - Low frequency oscillator).
\item Mod Freq: Frequency of the modulating wave (LFO).
\item Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the filtered signal.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter Type: Type of the filter (lowpass, highpass, bandpass or bandstop).
\item AM Mod Type: Waveform of the modulating LFO for amplitude modulation (saw up, saw down, square, triangle, pulse, bi-polar pulse, sample & hold or modulated sine).
\item FM Mod Type: Waveform of the modulating LFO for frequency modulation (saw up, saw down, square, triangle, pulse, bi-polar pulse, sample & hold or modulated sine).
\item Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
