Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Center Freq: Center frequency of the phaser (all-pass filter).
\item Q Factor: Q factor (resonance) of the phaser (all-pass filter).
\item Notch Spread: Distance between the phaser notches.
\item Feedback: Amount of phased signal fed back into the phaser.
\item Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the phased signal.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Stages: Number of stacked filters - changes notches bandwidth.
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
