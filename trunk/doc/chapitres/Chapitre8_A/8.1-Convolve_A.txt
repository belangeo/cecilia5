Circular convolution filtering module.

Sliders under the graph:
-Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the convoluted signal.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
-Size: Buffer size of the convolution (128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048).
-Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
-# of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
-Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
-Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
