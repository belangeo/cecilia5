Flanger effect based on a delay. Parameters: Depth (amplitude of the LFO that modulates the delay. The modulation is set around a central time of 5 milliseconds; depth factor = amplitude of the modulation in milliseconds/5 milliseconds), Freq (frequency of the modulating LFO) and Feed (feedback factor - enhances the resonances in the spectrum). In the "Type" menu, you can choose between activate (active) and bypass the effect.
