Compression and noise gate module.

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input Gain: Adjust the amount of signal sent to the processing chain.
\item Compression Thresh: Value in decibels at which the compressor becomes active.
\item Compression Rise Time: Time taken by the compressor to reach compression ratio.
\item Compression Fall Time: Time taken by the compressor to reach uncompressed state.
\item Compression Knee: Steepness of the compression curve.
\item Gate Thresh: Value in decibels at which the noise gate becomes active.
\item Gate Slope: Shape of the gate (rise time and fall time).
\item Output Gain: Makeup gain applied after the processing chain.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compression Ratio: Ratio between the compressed signal and the uncompressed signal.
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transfer Function: Table used for waveshaping
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
