Waveterrain synthesis module based on two stereo delays with parallel or serial routing.

Sliders under the graph:
-Delay 1 Right: Delay time of the right portion of the first delay.
-Delay 1 Left: Delay time of the left portion of the first delay.
-Delay 1 Feedback: Amount of the delayed signal fed back into the first delay.
-Delay 1 Mix: Gain of the first delayed signal.
-Delay 2 Right: Delay time of the right portion of the second delay.
-Delay 2 Left: Delay time of the left portion of the second delay.
-Delay 2 Feedback: Amount of the delayed signal fed back into the second delay.
-Delay 2 Mix: Gain of the second delayed signal.
-Jitter Amp: Amplitude of the jitter applied on the signal.
-Jitter Speed: Frequency of the jitter applied on the signal.
-Filter Freq: Center or cut-off frequency of the filter.
-Filter Q: Q factor of the filter.
-Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the processed signals.

Dropdown menus and toggles:
-Delay Routing: Type of delay routing (serial or parallel).
-Filter Type: Type of the filter (lowpass, highpass, bandpass or bandstop).
-Filter Routing: Determines if the filter is applied before or after the signal processing (pre or post).
-Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
-# of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
-Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.

Graph only parameters:
-Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
