Ranged filter module using band-pass filtering made with lowpass and highpass filters.

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter 1 limits: Range of the first filter (minimum value = cut-off frequency of the highpass filter; maximum value = cut-off frequency of the lowpass filter).
\item Filter 2 limits: Range of the first filter (minimum value = cut-off frequency of the highpass filter; maximum value = cut-off frequency of the lowpass filter).
\item Mix: **à vérifier!**
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Stages: Amount of stacked biquad filters.
\item Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
