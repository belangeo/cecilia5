Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency Splitter: Split points in the frequency range for multi-band processing.
\item Transpo Band 1: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the first band.
\item Feedback Band 1: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the first band harmonizer. 
\item Gain Band 1: Gain of the harmonized first band.
\item Transpo Band 2: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the second band.
\item Feedback Band 2: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the second band harmonizer. 
\item Gain Band 2: Gain of the harmonized second band.
\item Transpo Band 3: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the third band.
\item Feedback Band 3: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the third band harmonizer. 
\item Gain Band 3: Gain of the harmonized third band.
\item Transpo Band 4: Pitch shift in semi-tones for the fourth band.
\item Feedback Band 4: Amount of harmonized signal fed back into the fourth band harmonizer. 
\item Gain Band 4: Gain of the harmonized fourth band.
\item Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the harmonized signals.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Win Size: Window size (for delay). **à préciser**
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
