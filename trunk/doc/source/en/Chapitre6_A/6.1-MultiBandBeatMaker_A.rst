Multi-band algorithmic beatmaker module.

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency splitter: Split points of the frequency range for multi-band processing.
\item # of Taps: Number of taps in a measure.
\item Tempo: Speed of taps (in beats per minute).
\item Tap Length: Length of taps (in seconds).
\item Beat 1 Index: Soundfile index of the first beat.
\item Beat 2 Index: Soundfile index of the second beat.
\item Beat 3 Index: Soundfile index of the third beat.
\item Beat 4 Index: Soundfile index of the fourth beat.
\item Beat 1 Distribution: Repartition of taps for the first beat (100 % weak --> 100 % down).
\item Beat 2 Distribution: Repartition of taps for the second beat (100 % weak --> 100 % down).
\item Beat 3 Distribution: Repartition of taps for the third beat (100 % weak --> 100 % down).
\item Beat 4 Distribution: Repartition of taps for the fourth beat (100 % weak --> 100 % down).
\item Beat 1 Gain: Gain of the first beat.
\item Beat 2 Gain: Gain of the second beat.
\item Beat 3 Gain: Gain of the third beat.
\item Beat 4 Gain: Gain of the fourth beat.
\item Global Seed: Seed value for the algorithmic beats; using the same seed with the same distributions will yield the exact same beats.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Beat 1 ADSR: Envelope of taps for the first beat in breakpoint fashion.
\item Beat 2 ADSR: Envelope of taps for the second beat in breakpoint fashion.
\item Beat 3 ADSR: Envelope of taps for the third beat in breakpoint fashion.
\item Beat 4 ADSR: Envelope of taps for the fourth beat in breakpoint fashion.
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
