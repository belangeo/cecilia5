Vocoder module in which the user will have to choose two inputs: a source signal (see "Spectral Envelope" - a signal with a preferably rich spectral envelope) and an exciter (see "Exciter" - preferably a dynamic signal).

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Base Frequency: Frequency of the first filter of the analyzer.
\item Frequency Spread: Frequency spread factor - exponential operator that determinates the frequency of all other filters of the analyzer.
\item Q Factor: Q factor of the filters of the analyzer.
\item Time Response: **à vérifier**
\item Gain: Gain of the vocoder filters.
\item Num of Bands: **à vérifier** Number of filters for analyzing the signal.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
\item # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
