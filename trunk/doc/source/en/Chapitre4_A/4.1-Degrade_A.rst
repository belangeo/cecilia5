Sampling rate and bit depth degradation module with optional waveform aliasing around a clipping threshold.

**image 1-Parametres_Degrade.png**

Sliders under the graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bit Depth: Resolution of the amplitude in bits.
\item Sampling Rate Ratio: Ratio of the new sampling rate compared to the original one.
\item Wrap Threshold: Clipping limit (for the waveform aliasing) between -1 and 1 (signal then wraps around the thresholds).
\item Filter Freq: Center or cut-off frequency of the filter.
\item Filter Q: Q factor of the filter
\item Dry/Wet: Mix between the original signal and the degraded signal.
\end{itemize}

Dropdown menus and toggles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter Type: Type of filter (lowpass, highpass, bandpass or bandstop).
\item Clip Type: **à vérifier**Choose between degradation only or degradation with waveform aliasing.
\item Balance: Adjust the signal amplitude by comparing it with a sinusoidal wave with a fixed amplitude (see "compress") or with the amplitude of the source (see "source").
\item **à vérifier** # of Polyphony: Number of voices played simultaneously (polyphony); only available at initialization time.
\item **à vérifier** Polyphony Spread: Pitch variation between polyphony voices (chorus); only available at initialization time.
\end{itemize}

Graph only parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall Amplitude: The amplitude curve applied on the total duration of the performance.
\end{itemize}
