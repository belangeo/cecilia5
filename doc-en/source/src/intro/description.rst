Cecilia is an audio signal processing environment. Cecilia lets you create your own GUI (grapher, 
sliders, toggles, popup menus) using a simple syntax. Cecilia comes with many original built-in 
modules for sound effects and synthesis.

Previously written in tcl/tk by Jean Piché and Alexandre Burton, Cecilia (version 4) 
was entirely rewritten in Python/wxPython and used the Python-Csound API for communicating between 
the interface and the audio engine. At this time, version 4.2 is the last release of version 4.

Cecilia5 now uses Pyo, an audio engine written in C and created for the Python programming language. 
Pyo allows a much more powerful integration of the audio engine to the graphical interface. Since it 
is a standard python module, there is no need to use an API to communicate with the interface.

Cecilia is free and open source (`GNU GPL v3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_). 
Cecilia is programmed and maintained by Olivier Bélanger.
